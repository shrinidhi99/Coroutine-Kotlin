## What are coroutines?
```java
A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation, conceptually similar to a thread,
in the sense that it takes a block of code to run and has a similar life-cycle, it is
created and started, but it is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its
execution in one thread and resume in another one. Moreover, like a future or promise,
it may complete with some result or exception.
